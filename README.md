Project based on this tutorial

All rights/praise/kudos and/or pats on the back go to freeCodeCamp.org and his awesome Youtube
channel.

Install instructions

Note: personally I reccomend using .rbenv as a version manager. If you need help installing ruby, I
suggest starting here: https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv

1. Verify you are running ruby 3 or later (ruby -v)
2. Verify you are running rails 7 or later (rails -v)
3. Run `bundle install`
4. Run `rails s`
5. Homepage should be available at `localhost:3000`
